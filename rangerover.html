                The new special edition retains the Range Rover Sport SVR's 567bhp, 516lb ft 5.0-litre supercharged V8, so can crack the 0-60mph sprint in just 4.3 seconds and reach a top speed of 176mph. 
                This is immediately apparent in the design, with the vehicleâ€™s muscular, broad shouldered stance being the perfect complement to its performance and handling. 
                Exclusive larger air intakes in the front bumper promote even greater airflow to the two charge air coolers and the rear spoiler increases downforce at high speeds.
                Providing a supreme degree of support with maximum control, the lightweight SVR Performance seats in Windsor leather are heated as standard and offer cooling as an option. 
                With an embossed SVR logo on the headrest, these sleeker seats are available in four colour combinations and Cut Diamond perforation pattern.
