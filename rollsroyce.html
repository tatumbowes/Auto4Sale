            <h3>Rolls Royce Phantom</h3>

            <p>Price: R6870454,50</p>

            <p>
                The Rools Royce Phantom is a full sized luxury sedan manufactured by Rolls Royce Motor Cars.
                It is the eighth and current generation of the Rolls Royce Phantom, debut in 2017, and the second launched by Rolls Royce under BMW ownership.
                It is offered in two wheelbase lengths. This is the current flagship model made by Rolls Royce Motor Cars.
                The Phantom's interior is packed with modern conveniences and high-tech features to accompany its truly sumptuous environs. 
                A V-12 engine provides seemingly endless power, yet it purrs silently under the Phantom's long hood so as not to disturb the interior's restful ambience. 
                Fine leathers, real wood, and genuine metal parts cover every square inch of the cabin, and those relegated to the rear seat can relax in utmost comfort, especially in the long-wheelbase Extended model.
