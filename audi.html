            <h3>Audi R8 Coupe</h3>

            <p>Price: R2966019,63</p>

            <p>
                Audi has racing in its genes – and the Audi R8 Coupé V10 performance quattro has plenty of this genetic material. 
                You can see this from every angle: from the powerful air intakes next to the wide single-frame grille at the front, through the sharp-edged side lines, which gives a sense of the mid-mounted engine, through to the raised diffuser at the rear. 
                The V10 naturally aspirated engine, positioned between the axles, is at the heart of the Audi R8. In the performance version, this engine delivers 449kW. 
                This results in the sprint to reach to 100 km/h in just 3.1 seconds and increases the top speed to 331 km/h.
