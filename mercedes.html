                Mercedes-Benz's iconic G-wagen SUV has roots as a military vehicle, but the high-performance 2022 Mercedes-AMG G63 model serves an entirely different driver than the 1970s original. 
                A 577-hp twin-turbocharged V-8 engine gives the G63 incredible performance, and its posh cabin offers all the modern amenities we've come to expect from a top-spec Mercedes. 
                The AMG G63 SUV stands 77.4 inches tall and 86.1 inches wide, including the side mirrors, and weighs in at a hefty 2649.89 kgs.
                The G63 is available in a wide range of colors, none of them subtle. 
                The standard palette consists of 23 paints: 14 are no-cost options, while seven of the designo colors cost an additional R34712,93.
